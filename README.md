# mobx-state-tree-tools (WIP)

##TO DO
- Save state with name (a popup should open to insert a new name, with default name as "state" and default extension "json")
- when clicking on a state tree element, it should open that element in the DIFF state tree, already pinned.
- fix the overflow: auto and use SCSS
